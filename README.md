# site-la-plateforme

This is my "copy" of the website "La Plateforme_"
i restarted it 2 times because i lost my inspiration on the graphic (that is still bad af) but i have something interesting
feel free to chill, get some snack, get some water, grab a sausage, and enjoy the madness

11/19 edit : i have the final form for all of the pages as i like the header, the body and the footer. I just need to edit and furfill the footer bcs it's literally the VOID itself kekw.
Gonna break my record of time without playing any games (i hope next week gonna be easy, else... there will be bloodshed)

11/20 edit : WHY IS MY CODE IN GREEN IN laplateforme.css ?????? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AT LINE 29-30 IT'S FREAKING GREEN
please... i can't mentally handle it... i... i don't, i don't wanna be here. just joking but why is this green? i really don't understand  

11/21 midnight edit : a space was the cause of all of this T_T
This will be hard to complete all, and i'm already sleepy but nope, you have to work till you've finished (except for contact.html bcs no shit sherlock)
you must be a beat saber professional to end this in one day kekw

11/21 midnight 2nd edit: tired but deadline is for tomorrow... it's been so long since i didn't touch my game for a whole weekend (didn't even touch grass)
nah i don't get it, this is masochism... i invented something lmao, imagine a vampire piston : you put a vampire into a machine, kill it with holy water so the machine is retracted, and then you give blood to the vampire, that respawn and push up the piston. You just have to repeat the process and it's an infinite power that comes to you XDDDD
yeah, i'm in a mental breakdown, but i somehow like it
(i'll do the plesk update, and ask if i can continue this project tomorrow, because i'm a dogsht for the style, and this is why i'm stuck, because i don't like what comes to my mind, and i re start, and again, and again... until i find something good enough: actually, i don't really like the news.html, too impersonnal to me as i do it in a hurry. I would prefer remastering the whole design of each page, and changing all of the text, but if i did that, i would be still at accueil.html.
i hope they'll understand 

11/21 midnight 3rd edit : Plesk is finally managed to show my CV, but i didn't put all theses files, i'll do it tomorrow when i'm in the basement
i don't even feel the need to sleep by now, but i'll give it a try (pls make me wake up in time kekw)
