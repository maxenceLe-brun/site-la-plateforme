# site-la-plateforme

This is my "copy" of the website "La Plateforme_"
i restarted it 2 times because i lost my inspiration on the graphic (that is still bad af) but i have something interesting
feel free to chill, get some snack, get some water, grab a sausage, and enjoy the madness

11/19 edit : i have the final form for all of the pages as i like the header, the body and the footer. I just need to edit and furfill the footer bcs it's literally the VOID itself kekw.
Gonna break my record of time without playing any games (i hope next week gonna be easy, else... there will be bloodshed)

11/20 edit : WHY IS MY CODE IN GREEN IN laplateforme.css ?????? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AT LINE 29-30 IT'S FREAKING GREEN
please... i can't mentally handle it... i... i don't, i don't wanna be here. just joking but why is this green? i really don't understand
